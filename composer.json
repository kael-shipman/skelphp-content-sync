  "description" : "Skel ContentSync is a library for synchronizing content files with a Skel CMS database. It is intended to allow the user to manage content creation and editing in regular system files (which can be optionally version-controlled), while still providing the performance benefits of a database for the website. It is optimally used by creating a git repo for content files which has a post-recieve hook that calls a `sync-content.php` script on the main project every time a revision is pushed to the repo.",
